Deployed to https://zonteek.github.io/socnet/
You can't login because backend is made to prevent access besides localhost or whitelist domains.
Anyway you can clone this project and run with NPM or Yarn if you want to go furher login page.

Someday this project will be in whitelist or maybe I put screenshots instead of components if necessary.

This project has been inspired by IT-kamasutra React course.
